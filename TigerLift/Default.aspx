            As a fitness professional, I'm often asked question like, "How do I get in shape? How can I improve my muscle tone? How can I look more like you?!" I always try to offer answers and some encouragement, and I've received so much inspiration back in return from all of you. But as much as I love those opportunities to help people transform, they're one-on-one interactions. Now, to answer the thousands of questions I've received over the years and to reach those of you I would never otherwise meet, I've come up with one great program: my 12-week trainer. Your transformation guide, our partnership in fitness.
        <br />

            Who is this program for? Anyone of any age, of any sex, and from any walk of life. Including you. It'll produce great results and lead to lasting success for everyone. You're all starting from a unique place; no one has perfectly matched genetics, metabolism, hormones and lifestyles. But the beauty of this program is that you start at your own level and work at your own pace. Everyone's body is different, but the same training, diet, and supplement principles work for nearly everyone.
